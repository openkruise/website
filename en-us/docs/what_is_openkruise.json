It works well with original Kubernetes and provides more powerful and efficient features for managing applications Pods, sidecar containers, and even images on Node.</p>\n<h2 id=\"key-features\">Key features <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#key-features\">#</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>In-place update</strong></p>\n<p>In-place update is a way to update container images without deleting and creating Pod. It is quite faster than re-create update used by original Deployment/StatefulSet and less side-effect on other containers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sidecar management</strong></p>\n<p>Define sidecar containers in one CR and OpenKruise will inject them into all Pods matched. It's just like istio, but you can manage your own sidecars.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multiple fault domains deployment</strong></p>\n<p>Define a global workload over multiple fault domains, and OpenKruise will spread a sub workload for each domain. You can manage replicas, template and update strategies for workloads in different fault domains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Image pre-download</strong></p>\n<p>Help users download images on any nodes they want.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Container recreate/restart</strong></p>\n<p>Help users restart/recreate one or more containers in an existing Pod.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>...</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"controllers-and-webhooks\">Controllers and Webhooks <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#controllers-and-webhooks\">#</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CloneSet</strong></p>\n<p>CloneSet is a workload that mainly focuses on managing stateless applications. It provides full features for more efficient, deterministic and controlled deployment, such as inplace update, specified pod deletion, configurable priority/scatter update, preUpdate/postUpdate hooks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Advanced StatefulSet</strong></p>\n<p>An enhanced version of default StatefulSet with extra functionalities such as inplace-update, pause and MaxUnavailable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>SidecarSet</strong></p>\n<p>A controller that injects sidecar containers into the Pod spec based on selectors and also is able to upgrade the sidecar containers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>UnitedDeployment</strong></p>\n<p>This controller manages application pods spread in multiple fault domains by using multiple workloads.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>BroadcastJob</strong></p>\n<p>A job that runs Pods to completion across all the nodes in the cluster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Advanced DaemonSet</strong></p>\n<p>An enhanced version of default DaemonSet with extra functionalities such as partition, node selector, pause and surging.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>AdvancedCronJob</strong></p>\n<p>An extended CronJob controller, currently its template supports Job and BroadcastJob.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>ImagePullJob</strong></p>\n<p>Help users download images on any nodes they want.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>ContainerRecreateRequest</strong></p>\n<p>Provides a way to let users restart/recreate one or more containers in an existing Pod.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deletion Protection</strong></p>\n<p>Provides a safety policy which could help users protect Kubernetes resources and applications' availability from the cascading deletion mechanism.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>PodUnavailableBudget</strong></p>\n<p>In voluntary disruption scenarios, PodUnavailableBudget can achieve the effect of preventing application disruption or SLA degradation, which greatly improves the high availability of application services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>WorkloadSpread</strong></p>\n<p>Constrain the spread of stateless workload, which empowers single workload the abilities for multi-domain and elastic deployment.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
